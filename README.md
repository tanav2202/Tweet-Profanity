# Profanity Detection

This project contains a Python script that detects profanity in tweets. The script uses a list of profanity words and calculates the degree of profanity in each tweet. The results are saved in a CSV file.

## Usage

To run this script, you need to have Python 3 and the `pandas` package installed on your machine. You can install the required packages using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the script using the following command:

```
python profanity_detection.py
```

The script will read the `words.txt` and `tweets.txt` files in the same directory and generate a `degree_of_word_usage.csv` file with the results
